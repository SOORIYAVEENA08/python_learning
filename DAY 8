#DAY 8
'''
Given two arrays arr1[] and arr2[], the task is to find the number of elements in the union between these two arrays.

The Union of the two arrays can be defined as the set containing distinct elements from both arrays. If there are repetitions, then only one element occurrence should be there in the union.

Note: Elements are not necessarily distinct.

Examples

Input: arr1[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], arr2[] = [1, 2, 3]
Output: 5
Explanation: 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 are the elements which comes in the union setof both arrays. So count is 5.


Input: arr1[] = [85, 25, 1, 32, 54, 6], arr2[] = [85, 2] 
Output: 7
Explanation: 85, 25, 1, 32, 54, 6, and 2 are the elements which comes in the union set of both arrays. So count is 7.

#SOLUTION:

class Solution:    
    #Function to return the count of number of elements in union of two arrays.
    def doUnion(self,arr1,arr2):
    
        final_array=arr1+arr2
        y=(len(set(final_array)))  #using set because set does not allow duplicates and eventually we will obtain unquie elements in final_array
        return y
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        S1 = input().strip()
        S2 = input().strip()
        ob = Solution()
        print(ob.longestCommonSubstr(S1, S2))
#output: 5
